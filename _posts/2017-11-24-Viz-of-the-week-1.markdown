Hi folks! It's been a while since I last posted. Thought I'd start a blog series of all the interesting visualizations I found on social media this week. Hoping to post as often as possible given my tight schedule.

The football world cup qualification concluded last week and the 32 teams are all geared up for the 2018 world cup in Russia. Here's list of performance of the 32 teams in all the world cups.

What I most like about this viz is how the author has used a contrasting color pallete to demonstrate the winners from the rest. The chart conveys a lot of information and does not look too cluttered at the same time.

I am an avid user of Spotify. It helps me get through the day with some amazing suggestions. I recently stumbled upon this map of cities visualization by Spotify that demonstrates songs that are distinctive to each city.

This map is mind blowing for many reasons - the fact that they have been able to isolate songs that are just distinctive to a particular region is impressive. When they add trending playlists on top of this it becomes a really informative visualization. Here's a link to the [map](https://spotifymaps.github.io/musicalcities/). Happy thanksgiving and have a wonderful week!
